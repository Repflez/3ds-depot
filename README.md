3DS Depot, your future source of homebrew help

# Why?

I was interested in doing this since [http://gbatemp.net/threads/idea-save-data-server-upload-saves-to-share-download-to-enjoy.443183/](this thread.) Said fuck it, and I'm doing it. Slowly but doing it.

I plan to add more stuff other than a save server, like a mini theme repository with no content restrictions but the ones that my server host defines.
